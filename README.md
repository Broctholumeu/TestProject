# The Challenge

- Fork this project.
- Setup an instance of create-react-app.
- Setup material-ui.
- Setup redux.
- Import a material-ui drop down menu and add GBP, AUSD, and JPY as the options.
- Import a material-ui button and place it next to the dropdown menu.
- Add a space for text above these two elements that will display state directly from redux.
- Setup an API route that will get the exchange rate (base USD) from fixer.io and save it in redux.
- When pressing the button the code should fetch the exchange rate for the selection and update the text field.

When it's complete submit a PR here for review.
